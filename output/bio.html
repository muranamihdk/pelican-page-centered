    <h1>Biography</h1>
    

    <h2>Ishikawa Takuboku</h2>
<p>石川啄木<br />
1886−1912</p>
<p><strong>Ishikawa Takuboku</strong>, pseudonym of Ishikawa Hajime (born Oct. 28, 1886, Hinoto, Iwate prefecture, Japan—died April 13, 1912, Tokyo) Japanese poet, a master of tanka, a traditional Japanese verse form, whose works enjoyed immediate popularity for their freshness and startling imagery.</p>
<p>Although Takuboku failed to complete his education, through reading he acquired surprising familiarity with both Japanese and Western literature. He published his first collection of poetry, <em>Akogare</em> (“Yearning”), in 1905. In 1908 he settled in Tokyo, where, after associating with poets of the romantic Myōjō group, he gradually shifted toward naturalism and eventually turned to politically oriented writing.</p>
<p>In 1910 his first important collection, <em>Ichiaku no suna</em> (<em>A Handful of Sand</em>), appeared. The 551 poems were written in the traditional tanka form but were expressed in vivid, untraditional language. The tanka acquired with Takuboku an intellectual, often cynical, content, though he is also noted for the deeply personal tone of his poetry.</p>
<p>In Tokyo he earned his living as a proofreader and poetry editor of the <em>Asahi</em> newspaper, enduring financial hardship occasioned partly by his own improvidence. His life during this period is unforgettably described in his diaries, particularly <em>Rōmaji nikki</em> (first published in full in 1954; “Romaji Diary”). In this diary, which he wrote in Roman letters so that his wife could not read it, Takuboku recorded with overpowering honesty his complex emotional and intellectual life.</p>
<p>He also published fiction; but, despite its flashes of brilliance, it fails to match his poetry. A collection of poems in nontraditional forms, <em>Yobiko to Kuchibue</em> (1912; “Whistle and Flute”), shows some influence of anarchistic and socialistic thought. He died of chronic illness complicated by malnutrition, leaving the posthumous collection <em>Kanashiki gangu</em> (1912; <em>A Sad Toy</em>).</p>
