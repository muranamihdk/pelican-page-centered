    <p><strong> Ishikawa Takuboku</strong> (石川啄木, 1886−1912) is Japanese poet and novelist; especially known for his <strong><em>tanka</em></strong>, the traditional Japanese short poem of 31 syllables.</p>
<p>This site introduces his works and life.</p>
<h2>Works</h2>
<p>He intended to win fame for his novel, but failed it. In his despair and poverty, He "mistreated" the traditional short poem with a fixed form, that is tanka, to vent his indignation. As a results, he made tanka transform into a modern, urgent expression for the people living in the modern sciety.</p>
<p>"<em>Today, my friends seemed<br />
More a success than I.<br />
So I bought flowers<br />
And took them to<br />
My wife, to make her happy.</em>"</p>

<h2>Diary</h2>
<p>His diaries, especially which written in Rōmaji (roman letters) from April to June of 1909, is famous with its frankness and nakedness.</p>
<p>"<em>Why then have I decided to write this diary in Roman letters? What's the reason? I love my wife, and for the very reason I love her, I don't want her to read it. But I don't really mean that! That I love her is the truth, and that I love her is truth, and that I don't want her to read it is equally true, but these two statements aren't necessarily connected.</em>"</p>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Poverty, illness, and tanka—permeate many of the twenty-six years of Takuboku's life, and like the contradictory manifestations that moderns are bombarded with, such an unusual triumvirate represents Takuboku's fall and greatnes.</p>
