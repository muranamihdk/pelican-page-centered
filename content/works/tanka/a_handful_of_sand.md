Title: A handful of sand


東海の小島の磯の{白砂|しらすな}に
われ泣きぬれて
蟹とたはむる

On the white sand of a shore
Of a little island in the eastern sea
Soaked in tears, I play with a crab.


{頬|ほ}につたふ
なみだのごはず
{一握|いちあく}の砂を示しし人を忘れず

never forget
that man, tears
running down his face
a handful of sand
held out to show me


かにかくに渋民村は恋しかり
おもひでの山
おもひでの川

One thing and another
Makes me yearn for
Shibutami Village
The mountains I remember,
The river I recall


石をもて追はるるごとく
ふるさとを{出|い}でしかなしみ
消ゆる時なし

This sorrow of being driven from my home
As if pelted with stones
Will never disappear.


やはらかに柳あをめる
{北上|きたかみ}の{岸辺|きしべ}目に見ゆ
泣けとごとくに

On the far river bank
Fresh green, the tender willow:
As if she said, 'Weep for me.'


そのかみの神童の名のかなしさよ
ふるさとに来て泣くはそのこと

The sadness of it!
To have had the reputation of a prodigy—
That makes me weep when I come back home.


{頬|ほ}の寒き
流離の旅の人として
路問ふほどのこと言ひしのみ

A man with cold cheeks,
On a journey in an uncertain place—
All he asked was which road to take.


かの時に言ひそびれたる
大切の言葉は今も
胸にのこれど

Even now the vital words
I failed to say at the time
Linger in my breast.


ひややかに清き{大理石|なめいし}に
春の日の静かに照るは
かかる思ひならむ

I wonder if such love
Is like spring light shining softly
On cool, pure marble.


子を負ひて
雪の吹き入る停車場に
われ見送りし妻の眉かな

The child on her back
In the station with snow blowing in
The eyebrows of my wife who had come to see me off.


みぞれ降る
石狩の{野|の}の汽車に読みし
ツルゲエネフの物語かな

Sleet is falling
As the train crossed the Ishikari Plain
I read a novel by Turgenev.


わが去れる{後|のち}の噂を
おもひやる{旅出|たびで}はかなし
死ににゆくごと

The thought of their gossip, once they
Hear I've left, makes the journey sadder,
Like going to my death.


さいはての駅に下り立ち
雪あかり
さびしき街にあゆみ入りにき

I got off at the station on the line
And in the light of the snow
Walked into a loney town


わが{酔|ゑ}ひに心いためて
うたはざる女ありしが
いかになれるや

There was a woman who stopped singing
Worried about my drunkenness—
I wonder what happend to her.


よりそひて
深夜の雪の中に立つ
女の{右手|めて}のあたたかさかな

Close together
We stood a while in the late night snow—
How warm the woman's right hand was!


死ぬばかり我が{酔|ゑ}ふをまちて
いろいろの
かなしきことを{囁|ささや}きし人

Waiting till I was dead drunk,
She whispered to me
Those many sad things!


きしきしと寒さに踏めば板{軋|きし}む
かへりの廊下の
不意のくちづけ

On the way back along corridors
Creaking under these feet in the cold—
Her sudden kiss!


その{膝|ひざ}に{枕|まくら}しつつも
我がこころ
思ひしはみな我のことなり

While pillowing this head on her lap,
All I had in mind
Was myself.


かなしくも
{夜明|よあ}くるまでは残りゐぬ
息きれし{児|こ}の肌のぬくもり

Heart-breaking—
The warmth in the skin of a child who breathed his last
Lingering till the break of day.
