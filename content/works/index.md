Tanka
-----

***Tanka*** 短歌, literally “short poem”, is a 31-syllable poem consisting of five lines in the pattern 5−7−5−7−7; the dominant form in classical Japanese poetry (*waka* 和歌) from the 7th century to the present.

Takuboku's first collection of *tanka*, *Ichiaku no suna* (tr *A Handful of Sand*), was published in 1910 and contains 551 poems written in simple, direct language. Dealing with emotions and experiences taken from his daily life, these poems have a frankness and vitality all but unprecedented in Japanese poetry.

Takuboku died of tuberculosis on April 13 of 1912 at age of 27. A second *tanka* collection, *Kanashiki gangu* (tr *Sad Toys*), contains 194 poems, was published a few months later. Considered by many to be Japan's finest modern poet, Takuboku exercised a major influence upon the subsequent development of *tanka* written in the modern language.

Poem
-----

Takuboku's first volume of poetry, *Akogare* (Longing), was published in 1905. Written in the free verse manner of the shintaishi (“new-style poetry,” after the example of European poetry), *Akogare* attracted immediate public and critical attention for its startling imagery and outspokenness.

 A collection of poems in nontraditional forms, *Yobiko to Kuchibue* (1912; “Whistle and Flute”), shows some influence of anarchistic and socialistic thought.

Novel

He also published fiction; but, despite its flashes of brilliance, it fails to match his poetry.
