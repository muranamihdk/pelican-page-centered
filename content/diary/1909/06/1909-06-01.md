By sending Iwamoto with a letter to the office in the afternoon, I got an advance of twenty-five yen on this month's salary. But as I had to pay five yen to Mr. Sato, my take-home pay was twenty yen.
I went to Iwamoto's lodging and paid about thirteen yen for his and Shimizu's last month's rent (for which they had already paid six yen). Then I went with Iwamoto to Asakusa, and after a movie we ate at a Western-style restaurant. I gave him a yen for spending money and left.
I slept with a naive young girl whose name slips me. Next I went to see that girl resembling Koyakko that I had once slept with, Hanako. I went with the old woman to that strange place.
She told me she was already sixty-nine. Finally Hanako arrived. We slept. So pleasant somehow, sleeping with this girl.
I returned around ten. I had bought several magazines. Only forty sen left.
